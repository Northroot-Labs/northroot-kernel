# Event Model

**Note**: This document describes the generic event structure. For the protocol specification (invariants, identity computation, verification model), see [Core Specification](spec.md). For canonicalization rules, see [Canonicalization](canonicalization.md). For journal format, see [Journal Format](format.md). For extension patterns, see [Extensions](extensions.md).

## 0. Purpose

Northroot emits **Verifiable Events**: append-only, audit-grade evidence records
that are canonicalized, hash-identifiable, and optionally linked.

Northroot is intentionally **neutral**:
- It standardizes the **evidence format** and **verification rules**.
- It does NOT mandate any specific policy language, enforcement engine, agent framework,
  orchestration model, or runtime semantics.
- Domain-specific event types (authorization, execution, checkpoint, attestation, etc.) are defined by consuming applications or extension layers.

The trust kernel provides canonicalization and event identity primitives. Domain layers add typed schemas and semantic verification.

---

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1 Event
An immutable record in an append-only log, represented as a JSON object.

### 1.2 Verifiable Event
An event with:
- canonical JSON payload bytes (per canonicalization profile)
- `event_id` derived from a digest of canonical bytes
- explicit linkage to prior events (optional via `prev_event_id`)
- schema-defined structure (defined by domain layers)

### 1.3 Principal
The responsible actor for an action. Can be a human, service, agent, or org.
Northroot models all of these uniformly as `PrincipalID`.

---

## 2. Core invariants

### E1 — Append-only
Events are immutable once written. Corrections are represented as new events.

### E2 — Stable identity
Each event has:
- `event_id = H(domain_separator || canonical_bytes(event))`

Where `H` is SHA-256 and the domain separator is `b"northroot:event:v1\0"`.

### E3 — Canonicalization binding
Each event binds:
- `canonical_profile_id` (ProfileID)
- All fields that affect verification are part of the canonical payload

Verification MUST recompute digests from canonicalization rules.

### E4 — Offline verifiability
A verifier must be able to validate:
- canonicalization + digests
- event link consistency (if present)
without network calls.

---

## 3. Event envelope

All events share a common envelope:

- `event_type`: string (e.g., "test", "checkpoint", "attestation", "authorization", etc.)
- `event_version`: string (e.g., "1")
- `event_id`: Digest
- `occurred_at`: Timestamp
- `principal_id`: PrincipalID
- `canonical_profile_id`: ProfileID
- Optional `prev_event_id`: Digest (for hash-chain ordering)

Operational metadata (request ids, traces, retries, tags, provider hints, etc.) is explicitly
out-of-band. Core schemas carry verifiable evidence only; deployments may attach ops metadata
in transport-specific envelopes that are excluded from canonicalization and hashing.

---

## 4. Domain-specific events

Domain-specific event types (authorization, execution, checkpoint, attestation, reconciliation, etc.) are **not** part of the core trust kernel. Applications should:

1. Define their own event schemas following the canonicalization rules
2. Use `northroot-canonical` for canonicalization and event identity computation
3. Use `northroot-journal` for storage
4. Implement domain-specific verification logic externally

**Example**: An authorization event might include:
- `policy_id`, `policy_digest`
- `decision` ("allow" | "deny")
- `intent_digest`
- Domain-specific bounds and constraints

**Example**: A checkpoint event might include:
- `chain_tip_event_id`: Digest
- `chain_tip_height`: u64
- Optional `merkle_root` and `window`

But these fields are application-defined, not core primitives. See `wip/governance/` for example checkpoint/attestation schemas.

---

## 5. Event identity computation

Event identity is computed as:

```rust
event_id = sha256(b"northroot:event:v1\0" || canonical_json(event))
```

Where:
- The domain separator is fixed: `b"northroot:event:v1\0"`
- `canonical_json(event)` is the RFC 8785 canonical form of the entire event object
- The `event_id` field itself is excluded from the hash (to avoid self-reference)
- The result is base64url-no-pad encoded

See `northroot-canonical::compute_event_id` for the reference implementation.

---

## 6. Verification

Verification of an event involves:

1. Parse the JSON object from the journal
2. Extract the `event_id` field
3. Remove `event_id` from the object (temporarily)
4. Canonicalize the remaining object according to `canonical_profile_id`
5. Compute `event_id` using the domain separator and canonical bytes
6. Compare computed `event_id` to stored `event_id`

If they match, the event is valid. Domain-specific verification (policy checks, constraint validation, signature verification, etc.) is external to this core process.

---

## 7. Summary

The Northroot event model provides:
- A common envelope structure
- Deterministic event identity
- Primitives for domain-specific event types

Everything else—policy interpretation, enforcement, domain semantics, typed schemas—layers on top of the verified history.

---

## 8. Platform profile reference (v1)

For org-level convergence, Northroot-Labs maintains a minimal verifiable economic event profile:

- `schemas/platform/v1/economic_event.schema.json`

This profile is not part of the neutral kernel protocol. It is an integration contract that binds
cost/budget evidence to verifiable event identity while preserving core neutrality and offline verification.
